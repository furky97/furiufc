I want to create a Discord bot for my Esports UFC 5 league channel, which should have following commands

- "/ffl-xxx-register" where xxx is a number that i specify each time. 
  It should create a channel "ffl-xxx-register" where each user can register himself to participate in a league match via poll (1 day).
  Only the Admin role can write and manage in this channel. All others can only vote.
- "/ffl-xxx-start" where the poll participants get listed per comma
